The information on this page summarizes compiling RAPtor
with link time optimization (LTO) using the gnu compilers (-flto).
Link time optimization has been observed to produce significant speed-up.

The procedure for LTO varies from system to system.  Factors such as compiler version, linker version, mpi implementation all
effect the results.  The results are summarized for:
    1.- Blue Waters
    2.- Campus Cluster (University of Illinois)
    3.- Workstations

Important: The `ld` version has an impact in all cases; new versions link automatically.
