raptor
======

General, high performance algebraic multigrid solver

Requirements
------------

- `MPI`
- `cmake`


Build Instructions
------------------
1. Create a build directory
```bash
mkdir build
```
2. Configure the build
```bash
cd build
ccmake ..
```
Follow the onscreen instructions:

* press c to configure
* select/modify default options
  * ```ENABLE_UNIT_TESTS```: build unit tests and add to ctest
  * ```TEST_COMM_SIZE```: default MPI Communicator size for tests
* press g to generate and exit.
3. Build project
```bash
make
```
Note: make VERBOSE=1 if you want to see what flags are being used.

Unit Testing
------------

The build system is currently setup to use google test with ctest. The build
system currently looks through the source tree and adds anything it finds in a
test directory to ctest. For a simple example, look at
raptor/core/tests/ParVector.cpp.
